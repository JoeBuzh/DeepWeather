# DeepWeather
A Interesting Rain Forecast Model for Nowcasting.

### The shouder of Gaint

+ The framework of this DL is develped from Dr.Shi' research on 2015 NIPS.
+ Here is his website [sxjscience](https://sxjscience.github.io/)

### Features

+ END2END mode
+ Without professional datas like gfs, wrfout...
+ GPU avalible, tested in **Nvidia Quadro P4000**.

### Declear

+ This work was applied on some institutions, like airport climate center.
+ The work is not avalible for bussiness project due to is not the product version.
+ This work was a collabration of some engineers.
+ **The raw data of this projects was collected by another spider projects.**

### Structure

#### model
+ Save the train models and prepare for forecast

### Futuer Work
+ Moving to higher framework liek Pytorch or Keras.
+ Applying more feature engineering and pre_processing.
+ Constructing a fullstack data project, consist of data crawl, prepocess, DL forecast, visualize in app.
